# COMPILER LAB PROGRAMS(S7)
## Questions
1. Write a LEX program to display the number of lines, words, and characters in an input text.
2. Write a LEX program to convert the substring `abc` to `ABC` from the given input string.
3. Write a LEX program to find out the total number of vowels and consonants from the given input string.
4. Implement a Lexical Analyzer for a given program using the Lex tool.
5. Generate a YACC specification to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and parentheses.
6. Generate a YACC specification to recognize a valid identifier which starts with a letter followed by any number of letters or digits.
7. Implement a Calculator using LEX and YACC.
8. Convert the BNF rules into YACC form and write code to generate an abstract syntax tree.
9. Design and implement a lexical analyzer using C language to recognize all valid tokens in the input program. The lexical analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs, and newlines. It should also ignore comments.
10. Write a program to find **First** and **Follow** of any given grammar.
11. Design and implement a **Recursive Descent Parser** for a given grammar.
12. Construct a **Shift Reduce Parser** for a given language.
13. Write a program to perform **Constant Propagation**.
14. Implement **Intermediate Code Generation** for simple expressions.
15. Implement the **Back End** of the compiler which takes the three-address code and produces the 8086 assembly language instructions that can be assembled and run using an 8086 assembler.
16. Write a program to find **ε-closure** of all states of any given NFA with ε-transitions.
17. Write a program to convert NFA with ε-transition to NFA without ε-transition.
